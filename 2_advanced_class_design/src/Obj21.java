/**
    2.1 Develop code that uses abstract classes and methods

- can be applied to a class or a non-static method.
- An abstract class may have methods or fields declared static. However, the abstract keyword cannot be applied to fields or static methods.
- An abstract class can extend another abstract class or can implement an interface.
 - An abstract class can be derived from a concrete class! Although the language allows  it, it is not a good idea to do so.
 - An abstract class need not declare an abstract method, which means it is not  necessary for an abstract class to have any methods declared as abstract. However, if
 a class has an abstract method, it should be declared as an abstract class.
 - A subclass of an abstract class needs to provide implementation of all the abstract  methods; otherwise you need to declare that subclass as an abstract class.
